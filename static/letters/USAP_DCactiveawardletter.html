        Dear Dr. ***PI LAST NAME***,<br>
        <p>
            Welcome to the United States Antarctic Program Data Center.  USAP-DC supports NSF-funded researchers in fulfilling your data management 
            obligations* and provides a central record of NSF-funded Antarctic projects and data.  Your NSF OPP award ***NUMBER - TITLE*** can now 
            be registered at <a href="https://www.usap-dc.org">www.usap-dc.org</a>.
        </p>
       
        <p>
            Complete the webform at <a href="https://www.usap-dc.org/submit/project">https://www.usap-dc.org/submit/project</a> to be guided through 
            the necessary steps to register your project and create a project page. For Collaborative Research projects, there should be only one 
            project page - we recommend that the PI of the lead institution sets up the project page and can link the other awards during registration. 
            Confirm with your program manager if you think that your award will not require a project page (e.g., workshop proposals).
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Throughout the duration of the project, named project personnel can update the project page with new datasets and publications.  As datasets 
            become available, they should be linked to the project either through submission for archiving at the USAP-DC or as links to external 
            archives.  We will use the information you provide to create an entry for your project in the Antarctic Master Database. Project pages can 
            also be created for past awards.
        </p>
