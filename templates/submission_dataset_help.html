    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        The dataset submission and ingestion process is very straightforward. You (the submitter) will fill out the Dataset Deposit Form with all the required information.
        Throughout the process, you may save your current submission and return to it at any point. Once submitted you will receive an email notification of a completed submission.
        The submitted dataset will be reviewed by USAP-DC Curators, who will check the data integrity and necessary metadata information. This review process usually takes 1-2 business days.
        Curators may contact you directly if we have any questions regarding your submission. Once the process is finished, you will be notified by the USAP-DC Curators via email.
    </p>
    <h3>Why submit your data?</h3>
    <p>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2022/nsf22106/nsf22106.jsp">NSF guidelines</a> 
        require full datasets, metadata files, and derived data products to be deposited in a long-term and publicly accessible archive. 
        USAP-DC accepts all data submissions resulting from Antarctic NSF award funding. We provide repository services for these data
        including publication in the DOI<span>&#174;</span> system and long-term archiving.
        
    </p>

    <h3>I am submitting this data for a publication that is currently in-review. Does this change anything?</h3>
    <p>
        YES! Please let us know these data are potentially subject to change. Officially registered DataCite DOIs are reserved for final data products.
        There are two (2) options available to you: (1) register this data as a final product and create a new version with a new DOI should the data files
        change during the review process. (2) place the files under embargo, or postpone the DOI registration until the review process is complete.
        During the proof stage of your publication, you may work with a USAP-DC Curator to ensure your DOI is up-to-date and functional.
    </p>

    <h3>My data is already in another archive! What should I do?</h3>
    <p>
        Please do not archive a duplicate dataset. We encourage you to use a discipline specific repository for your data type (e.g. IRIS, Genbank, R2R).
        However, we ask that you provide the dataset link of that archive for the associated Project Page within the USAP-DC Project Catalog. You may add
        this link yourself, or request assistance from a Curator. This prevents duplicate copies within archives, but ensures the proper footprint
        for external datasets and the USAP-DC.
    </p>

    <p>
        USAP-DC accepts data submissions of research data resulting from NSF-funded Antarctic projects and provides repository 
        services for these data including data publication in the DOI<span>&#174;</span> system and long-term archiving. 
        Note that for cases where there is an established disciplinary archive for your data type (e.g. IRIS, Genbank, R2R) we 
        encourage you to use this archive and register the dataset links or DOI’s from this repository in your USAP-DC Project 
        Catalog entry. 
    </p>

    <h3>Submitting Data Files</h3>
    <p>
        You can upload one (1) or more data files as part of a single submission. If the dataset is large (>5GB), please contact us directly to arrange a data transfer.
        <!-- To submit data to USAP-DC, please use our <a target="_blank" href="{{url_for('dataset')}}">“Deposit Dataset”</a> webform.   -->
    </p>
    <p>
        Dataset files submitted to USAP-DC <strong>should be final data products</strong>.
        If you anticipate changes to these files, please contact <a target="_blank" href="{{url_for('contact')}}">info@usap-dc.org</a> to discuss your options.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dataset files should adhere to the following guidelines:
        <ul style="list-style-type:none">
            <li>Clear and descriptive file names, open or common file format, follow standard units of measurement, and geolocation (if applicable)</li>
            <li>Headers and Tabular data should have clear names and definitions. For guidance on tabular data organization, please see
                <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989">Data Organization in spreadsheets</a> by Broman and Woo (2018).</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h4>Dataset Title & Abstract</h4>
    <p>
        Each dataset is required to have a title and abstract, which appear on the landing page and are used to help others find data of interest.
        A good dataset title is concise, but with enough specific detail to express the unique nature of the dataset. This title will be associated with the DOI record.
    </p>
    <p>
        Titles may include the following:<br>
        Data type, location, temporal range, field program, and sensor information.<br>
        Example: “Firn-temperatures 1999-2001 Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica”
    </p>
    <p>
        The abstract (or summary) is a requirement for dataset submission. A good abstract contains ample information specific to the associated dataset.
        This summary will inform users about the data in question and help them work with your dataset should they choose to reuse it.
        This abstract should not be a copy of the award abstract, only a manuscript citation, pointing to the ReadMe, or use vague language.
    </p>
    <p>
        Abstracts should include the following where possible:
        Data type, location, acquisition information, temporal range, date of generation, processing steps, processed product level, file format, and/or non-NSF funding.
    </p>

    <h4>NSF Award Number</h4>
    <p>
        If an NSF award exists, the dataset will be linked to it. Using this award number, the dataset will automatically link to any existing
        USAP-DC Project Page connected to the award number.Multiple award numbers are allowed, with one selected as the “main award.”
    </p>

    <h4>Related Publications/References</h4>
    <p>
        If there are relevant publications (e.g. a manuscript that describes the details of the dataset), the citation should be included.
        This publication should not be included in lieu of an abstract/summary, but in support.
        Please provide the publication DOI and full citation, so we can link to it directly.
    </p>

    <h4>ReadMe Files</h4>
    <p>
        The submission form includes several free-text fields, with prompts, for providing details regarding the dataset.
        Information to include would be: instruments, acquisition, processing procedures, and data use guidelines.
        This file will allow future users to understand and use the data easily and quickly.
        An alternative is to include additional documentation as a downloadable file with your dataset.
        We do not recommend leaving any ReadMe fields blank, despite the additional file.<br>
        Consider what you would want in a dataset ReadMe if you were reusing the data. 
    </p>

    <h4>License</h4>
    <p>
        Choosing a license for dataset use provides a clear framework for future reuse of the data. We make use of <a target="_blank" 
        href="https://creativecommons.org/choose">Creative Commons</a> licenses for assigning terms of acceptable reuse. The 
        default choice is CC BY 4.0, which allows reusers to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium 
        or format, provided attribution is given to the creator.
        <br>An alternative option is CC 0, which allows any reuse without conditions.
    </p>

    <h4>Embargos</h4>
    <p>
        USAP-DC provides the ability to embargo data until a specific date. During this time, changes to the submitted files may occur,
        but are not encouraged. Please <a href="/contact">contact USAP-DC staff</a> to inquire further about this feature.
    </p>

    <h4>Revisions & Updates</h4>
    <p>
        Co-PIs associated (linked) to the dataset will be able to use the “Edit” function – located in the top-right corner of the dataset landing page.
        Use this feature to update dataset information, publication information, co-PI association, etc.
        These revisions will be assessed by USAP-DC Curators, and then published.<br>
        Replacing dataset files will automatically generate a new version of the dataset, with a link to the previous version.
